# AlgorithmInJava_3rd_Edition

This's extensive code of Book *DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHM ANALYSIS IN JAVA (Third Edition)*, by Mark Allen Weiss.

Some codes were added to the [original code package](http://users.cis.fiu.edu/~weiss/dsaajava3/code/) to make the package more clear and complete.

I added the codes **for practice purpose.**

Feel free to create an issue or pull request if you find an error and please consider give me a star if it helps.
